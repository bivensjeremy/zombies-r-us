One Page Website from Udemy Project

This project was creating following a guide from Angela Yu's "The Complete 2021 Web Development Bootcamp". Her example created a Tinder lookalike called "TinDog". This is my reproduction using my own code.  

The project only uses HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. I gauged how well her course is by how I was able to recreate the page in my own vision. I give the course a 7/10. While I was able to create the page with minimal "WTF moments", I had to reference containers and how to properly position things a lot. The CSS is generally a mess. I found it easier to section each area off and write the CSS based on where I was on the page rather than compiling similar areas into groups.  This means I duplicated a lot of elements.  She teaches this in a section by itself instead of as she went along. As a beginner, I will give myself a pass, though!

Overall, I feel like I understand a lot of tools I did not understand before. So I think it is worth it! Practice makes perfect!
